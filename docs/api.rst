API
===
The :py:class:`Client <tredis.Client>` class is the primary API
interface for interacting with Redis. While the per-method documentation
attempts to be as complete as possible, the best documentation source for
each Redis command is available `on the redis site <http://redis.io/commands>`_.

See the :doc:`supported-commands` documentation if you are not able to find
a Redis command you are looking for.
